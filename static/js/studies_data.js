    "Summary": "Single-cell RNA sequencing, fate tracking and microscopy reveal the diversity and unique transcriptional characteristics of non-substantial macrophages in the border areas of the mouse brain (such as the dura, subarachnoid space and choroidal plexus). The study found that these border-associated macrophages (BAMs) differ in tissue-specific transcriptional characteristics, composition changes during development, and self-renewal ability. In addition, the study identified a unique subpopulation of microglia located on the epithelial surface of the choroid plexus.",

    "Summary": "There is currently little information available about how individual cell types contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Here we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to entorhinal cortex samples from control and Alzheimer\u2019s disease brains (n\u2009=\u20096 per group), yielding a total of 13,214 high-quality nuclei. We detail cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, unveiling how transcriptional changes in specific cell subpopulations are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We report that the Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk gene APOE is specifically repressed in Alzheimer\u2019s disease oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and astrocyte subpopulations and upregulated in an Alzheimer\u2019s disease-specific microglial subopulation. Integrating transcription factor regulatory modules with Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk loci revealed drivers of cell-type-specific state transitions towards Alzheimer\u2019s disease. For example, transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal function, regulates multiple disease genes in a specific Alzheimer\u2019s disease astrocyte subpopulation. These results provide insights into the coordinated control of Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk genes and their cell-type-specific contribution to disease susceptibility. These results are available at http://adsn.ddnetbio.com.",

    "Summary": "Hippocampus is a critical region involved in learning, memory and various brain disorders. The molecular diversity of various glial cells in the human hippocampus and their temporal changes over the postnatal life remain largely unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to create a transcriptome atlas of the human hippocampus across the postnatal lifespan and in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Detailed analyses of astrocytes, oligodendrocyte lineages, and microglia identified subpopulations with distinct transcriptomic signatures, transcription factor expression patterns, association with specific biological processes, and changes in their abundance with age. Enrichment analysis of brain disorder risk gene expression further implicates specific glial cells and subpopulations in various brain disorders. Furthermore, we identified dysregulated gene expression in specific glial subpopulations in the hippocampus of AD patients. Together, these data provide a rich resource and significantly extend our understanding of human glial cell diversity and their temporal distribution across the postnatal lifespan",

Here we present the first single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions, by performing single cell long-read transcriptome sequencing in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7. Using isoform tests for brain-region specific DIE, which outperform exon-based tests, we detect hundreds of brain-region specific DIE events traceable to specific cell-types. Many DIE events correspond to functionally distinct protein isoforms, some with just a 6-nucleotide exon variant. In most instances, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. Cell types indigenous to only one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, where for example, the choroid plexus epithelium manifest unique transcription start sites. However, for some genes, multiple cell-types are responsible for DIE in bulk data, indicating that regional identity can, although less frequently, override cell-type specificity.

    "Summary": "Single-cell transcriptomics has been widely applied to classify neurons in the mammalian brain, while systems neuroscience has historically analyzed the encoding properties of cortical neurons without considering cell types. Here we examine how specific transcriptomic types of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) projection neurons relate to axonal projections and encoding properties across multiple cognitive tasks. We found that most types projected to multiple targets, and most targets received projections from multiple types, except PFC\u2192PAG (periaqueductal gray). By comparing Ca2+ activity of the molecularly homogeneous PFC\u2192PAG type against two heterogeneous classes in several two-alternative choice tasks in freely moving mice, we found that all task-related signals assayed were qualitatively present in all examined classes. However, PAG-projecting neurons most potently encoded choice in cued tasks, whereas contralateral PFC-projecting neurons most potently encoded reward context in an uncued task. Thus, task signals are organized redundantly, but with clear quantitative biases across cells of specific molecular-anatomical characteristics.",

    "Summary": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and is characterized by abnormal extracellular aggregates of amyloid-b and intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated, tau tangles and neuropil threads. Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are important for CNS homeostasis and implicated in AD pathology. In amyloid mouse models, a phagocytic/activated microglia phenotype has been identified. How increasing levels of amyloid-b and tau pathology affect human microglia transcriptional profiles is unknown. Here, we performed snRNAseq on 482,472 nuclei from non-demented control brains and AD brains containing only amyloid-b plaques or both amyloid-b plaques and tau pathology. Within the microglia population, distinct expression profiles were identified of which two were AD pathology-associated. The phagocytic/activated AD1-microglia population abundance strongly correlated with tissue amyloid-b load and localized to amyloid-b plaques. The AD2-microglia abundance strongly correlated with tissue phospho-tau load and these microglia were more abundant in samples with over tau pathology. This full characterization of human disease associated microglia phenotypes provides new insights in the pathophysiological role of microglia in AD and offers new targets for microglia-state-specific therapeutic strategies.",

    "Summary": "To better define roles that microglia and astrocytes play in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), we used single-nuclei RNA-sequencing to comprehensively characterize transcriptomes in these glial nuclei isolated post mortem from non-diseased control and neuropathologically-defined AD brains. Genes associated with AD risk were highly represented, especially in microglia. Transcriptome differences significantly correlated with immunohistochemical phospho-Tau (pTau) density included genetic risk genes for both microglia (APOE, BIN1, MS4A6A, PILRA) and astrocytes (APOE, CLU, MEF2C, IQCK). Pathways associated with the top differentially expressed genes in microglia included those related to proteostasis and immune modulation while those for astrocytes also included proteostasis, as well as stress response and metal ion homeostasis. Inferred regulons generated from co-expression networks implicated distinct transcriptional mechanisms associated with pTau for the two cell types. Data-driven sub-clustering revealed additional glial cellular heterogeneity. Our work provides a new resource, highlighting both potential causal mechanisms and protective glial responses in AD.",

Intravenously injected CLU strongly binds to brain endothelial cells reducing their inflammatory gene expression in an acute model of brain inflammation and in Alzheimer\u2019s disease model mice.

    "Summary": "Human brain development is underpinned by cellular and molecular reconfigurations continuing into the third decade of life. To reveal cell dynamics orchestrating neural maturation, we profiled human prefrontal cortex gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution from gestation to adulthood. Integrative analyses define the dynamic trajectories of each cell type, revealing major gene expression reconfiguration at the prenatal-to-postnatal transition in all cell types followed by continuous reconfiguration into adulthood and identifying regulatory networks guiding cellular developmental programs, states, and functions. We uncover links between expression dynamics and developmental milestones, characterize the diverse timing of when cells acquire adult-like states, and identify molecular convergence from distinct developmental origins. We further reveal cellular dynamics and their regulators implicated in neurological disorders. Finally, using this reference, we benchmark cell identities and maturation states in organoid models. Together, this captures the dynamic regulatory landscape of human cortical development.",

    "Summary": "Experimental models of the human brain are needed for basic understanding of its development and disease. Human brain organoids hold unprecedented promise for this purpose; however, they are plagued by high organoid-to-organoid variability2,3. This has raised doubts as to whether developmental processes of the human brain can occur outside the context of embryogenesis with a degree of reproducibility that is comparable to the endogenous tissue. Here we show that an organoid model of the dorsal forebrain can reliably generate a rich diversity of cell types appropriate for the human cerebral cortex. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of 166,242 cells isolated from 21 individual organoids, finding that 95% of the organoids generate a virtually indistinguishable compendium of cell types, following similar developmental trajectories and with a degree of organoid-to-organoid variability comparable to that of individual endogenous brains. Furthermore, organoids derived from different stem cell lines show consistent reproducibility in the cell types produced. The data demonstrate that reproducible development of the complex cellular diversity of the central nervous system does not require the context of the embryo, and that establishment of terminal cell identity is a highly constrained process that can emerge from diverse stem cell origins and growth environments.",

We apply inCITE-seq to characterize cell state-related changes upon pharmacological induction of neuronal activity in the mouse brain. Modeling gene expression as a linear combination of quantitative protein levels revealed genome-wide associations of each TF and recovered known gene targets. TF-associated genes were coexpressed as distinct modules that each reflected positive or negative TF levels, showing that our approach can disentangle relative putative contributions of TFs to gene expression and add interpretability to inferred gene networks. inCITE-seq can illuminate how combinations of nuclear proteins shape gene expression in native tissue contexts, with direct applications to solid or frozen tissues and clinical specimens.",

    "Summary": "The diversity and complex organization of cells in the brain have hindered systematic characterization of age-related changes in its cellular and molecular architecture, limiting our ability to understand the mechanisms underlying its functional decline during aging. Here, we generated a high-resolution cell atlas of brain aging within the frontal cortex and striatum using spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics and quantified changes in gene expression and spatial organization of major cell types in these regions over the mouse lifespan. We observed substantially more pronounced changes in cell state, gene expression, and spatial organization of non-neuronal cells over neurons. Our data revealed molecular and spatial signatures of glial and immune cell activation during aging, particularly enriched in the subcortical white matter, and identified both similarities and notable differences in cell-activation patterns induced by aging and systemic inflammatory challenge.

However, the molecular signatures that distinguish between aggregation-prone and aggregation-resistant cell states are unknown. We developed methods for the high-throughput isolation and transcriptome profiling of single somas with NFTs fro\u00acm human AD brain, quantified the susceptibility of 20 neocortical subtypes for NFT formation and death, and identified both shared and cell-type-specific signatures. NFT-bearing neurons shared a marked upregulation of synaptic transmission-related genes, including a core set of 63 genes enriched for synaptic vesicle cycling. Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction were highly cell-type dependent. Apoptosis was only modestly enriched, and the susceptibilities of NFT-bearing and NFT-free neurons for death were highly similar. Our analysis suggests that NFTs represent cell-type-specific responses to stress and synaptic dysfunction. We provide a resource for biomarker discovery and the investigation of tau-dependent and tau-independent mechanisms of neurodegeneration.",

    "Summary": "Despite advances in genetic and proteomic techniques, a complete portrait of the proteome and its complement of dynamic interactions and modifications remains a lofty, and as of yet, unrealized, objective. Specifically, traditional biological and analytical approaches have not been able to address key questions relating to the interactions of proteins with small molecules, including drugs, drug candidates, metabolites, or protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). Fortunately, chemists have bridged this experimental gap through the creation of bioorthogonal reactions. These reactions allow for the incorporation of chemical groups with highly selective reactivity into small molecules or protein modifications without perturbing their biological function, enabling the selective installation of an analysis tag for downstream investigations. The introduction of chemical strategies to parse and enrich subsets of the \"functional\" proteome has empowered mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods to delve more deeply and precisely into the biochemical state of cells and its perturbations by small molecules. In this Primer, we discuss how one of the most versatile bioorthogonal reactions, \"click chemistry\", has been exploited to overcome limitations of biological approaches to enable the selective marking and functional investigation of critical protein-small-molecule interactions and PTMs in native biological environments.",

Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) cause autosomal-dominant FTD (FTD-GRN), associated with TDP-43 inclusions, neuronal loss, axonal degeneration and gliosis, but FTD-GRN pathogenesis is largely unresolved. Here we report single-nucleus RNA sequencing of microglia, astrocytes and the neurovasculature from frontal, temporal and occipital cortical tissue from control and FTD-GRN brains. We show that fibroblast and mesenchymal cell numbers were enriched in FTD-GRN, and we identified disease-associated subtypes of astrocytes and endothelial cells. Expression of gene modules associated with blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction was significantly enriched in FTD-GRN endothelial cells. The vasculature supportive function and capillary coverage by pericytes was reduced in FTD-GRN tissue, with increased and hypertrophic vascularization and an enrichment of perivascular T cells. Our results indicate a perturbed BBB and suggest that the neurovascular unit is severely affected in FTD-GRN.",

    "Summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are two incurable and fatal neurodegenerative conditions. While distinct, they share many clinical, genetic, and pathological characteristics, and both show highly vulnerable layer 5 extratelencephalic-projecting cortical populations, including Betz cells in ALS2 and von Economo neurons (VENs) in FTLD. Here, we report the first single-cell atlas of the human primary motor cortex and its changes in ALS and FTLD across ~380,000 nuclei from 64 control, sporadic and C9orf72-associated ALS and FTLD individuals. We identify 46 transcriptionally distinct cellular subtypes including two Betz-cell subtypes, and observe a previously-unappreciated molecular similarity between Betz cells and VENs of the frontal insula. Most dysregulated genes and pathways were shared, including stress response, ribosome function, oxidative phosphorylation, synaptic vesicle cycle, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and autophagy. Betz cells and SCN4B+ long-range projecting L3/L5 cells are the most transcriptionally affected in both ALS and FTLD. Lastly, the VEN/Betz-cell-enriched dysregulated gene POU3F1 co-localizes with TDP-43 aggregates in Betz cells.",

    "Summary": "The bHLH transcription factor TCF4 plays an important role in neurodevelopment highlighted by its association with schizophrenia and Pitt-Hopkins-Syndrome. Here we demonstrate that TCF4 function is essential for forebrain commissure formation in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing of TCF4 knockout neocortices revealed dysregulation of multiple gene regulatory networks. We provide evidence that TCF4 controls the underlying regulons by interaction with the regulators, transcription factors surprisingly not belonging to the known canonical interactors of the bHLH family. In-depth analysis of the interplay between TCF4 and SOX11 showed a synergistic effect on commissural formation. Mice haploinsufficient for Sox11 or Tcf4 showed no commissural phenotype or only a mild callosal shortening, respectively, whereas Tcf4/Sox11 double haploinsufficient mice display aggravated corpus callosum dysgenesis and anterior commissure agenesis. Moreover, TCF4 and SOX11 synergistically induce the expression of common target genes. Collectively, these findings illuminate how TCF4 dysregulation influences brain development and contributes to neurodevelopmental diseases.",

    "Summary": "The complex neuropathology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is difficult to dissect, given the convoluted cytoarchitecture of affected brain regions such as the hippocampus. Hippocampal dysfunction during TBI results in cognitive decline that may escalate to other neurological disorders, the molecular basis of which is hidden in the genomic programs of individual cells. Using the unbiased single cell sequencing method Drop-seq, we report that concussive TBI affects previously undefined cell populations, in addition to classical hippocampal cell types. TBI also impacts cell type-specific genes and pathways and alters gene co-expression across cell types, suggesting hidden pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic target pathways. Modulating the thyroid hormone pathway as informed by the T4 transporter transthyretin Ttr mitigates TBI-associated genomic and behavioral abnormalities. Thus, single cell genomics provides unique information about how TBI impacts diverse hippocampal cell types, adding new insights into the pathogenic pathways amenable to therapeutics in TBI and related disorders.",

    "Summary": "Three-dimensional brain organoids have emerged as a valuable model system for studies of human brain development and pathology. Here we establish a midbrain organoid culture system to study the developmental trajectory from pluripotent stem cells to mature dopamine neurons. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identify the presence of three molecularly distinct subtypes of human dopamine neurons with high similarity to those in developing and adult human midbrain. However, despite significant advancements in the field, the use of brain organoids can be limited by issues of reproducibility and incomplete maturation which was also observed in this study. We therefore designed bioengineered ventral midbrain organoids supported by recombinant spider-silk microfibers functionalized with full-length human laminin. We show that silk organoids reproduce key molecular aspects of dopamine neurogenesis and reduce inter-organoid variability in terms of cell type composition and dopamine neuron formation.",

    "DOI/Publication Link": "https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.64875",
    "Summary": "Abundant evidence supports the presence of at least three distinct types of thalamocortical (TC) neurons in the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, the brain region that conveys visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). Different types of TC neurons in mice, humans, and macaques have distinct morphologies, distinct connectivity patterns, and convey different aspects of visual information to the cortex. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these cell types, and how these relate to differences in dLGN between human, macaque, and mice, we profiled gene expression in single nuclei and cells using RNA-sequencing. These efforts identified four distinct types of TC neurons in the primate dLGN: magnocellular (M) neurons, parvocellular (P) neurons, and two types of koniocellular (K) neurons. Despite extensively documented morphological and physiological differences between M and P neurons, we identified few genes with significant differential expression between transcriptomic cell types corresponding to these two neuronal populations. Likewise, the dominant feature of TC neurons of the adult mouse dLGN is high transcriptomic similarity, with an axis of heterogeneity that aligns with core vs. shell portions of mouse dLGN. Together, these data show that transcriptomic differences between principal cell types in the mature mammalian dLGN are subtle relative to the observed differences in morphology and cortical projection targets. Finally, alignment of transcriptome profiles across species highlights expanded diversity of GABAergic neurons in primate versus mouse dLGN and homologous types of TC neurons in primates that are distinct from TC neurons in mouse.",

Within the olfactory bulb (OB), odor information is processed by subtypes of inhibitory interneurons whose heterogeneity and functionality is influenced by ongoing adult neurogenesis. To investigate this cellular heterogeneity, and to better understand the developmental programs of adult-born neurons, we utilized single cell RNA sequencing and computational modeling to reveal diverse and transcriptionally distinct neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. We also analyzed molecular changes during adult-born interneuron maturation, and uncovered developmental programs within their gene expression profiles. Finally, we discovered that distinct neuronal subtypes are differentially affected by sensory experience. Together, these data provide a transcriptome-based foundation for investigating subtype-specific neuronal function in the OB, charting the molecular profiles that arise during the maturation and integration of adult-born neurons, and documenting activity-dependent changes in the cellular composition of the olfactory system.",

To that end, we integrated AD GWAS results with human brain proteomes to perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of AD, followed by Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis. We identified 11 genes that are consistent with being causal in AD, acting via their cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Nine replicated in a confirmation PWAS and eight represent new AD risk genes not identified before by AD GWAS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our results were independent of APOE e4.

    "Summary": "Single cell/nucleus technologies are powerful tools to study cell type-specific expression in the human brain, but most large-scale efforts have focused on characterizing cortical brain regions and their constituent cell types. However, additional brain regions - particularly those embedded in basal ganglia and limbic circuits - play important roles in neuropsychiatric disorders and addiction, suggesting a critical need to better understand their molecular characteristics. We therefore created a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) resource across five human brain regions (hippocampus, HPC; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC; subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, sACC; nucleus accumbens, NAc; and amygdala, AMY), with emphasis on the NAc and AMY, given their involvement in reward signaling and emotional processing. We identified distinct and potentially novel neuronal subpopulations, which we validated by smFISH for various subclasses of NAc interneurons and medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We additionally benchmarked these datasets against published datasets for corresponding regions in rodent models to define cross-species convergence and divergence across analogous cell subclasses. We characterized the transcriptomic architecture of regionally-defined neuronal subpopulations, which revealed strong patterns of similarities in specific neuronal subclasses across the five profiled regions. Finally, we measured genetic associations between risk for psychiatric disease and substance use behaviors with each of the regionally-defined cell types. This analysis further supported NAc and AMY involvement in risk for psychiatric illness by implicating specific neuronal subpopulations, and highlighted potential involvement of an MSN population associated with stress signaling in genetic risk for substance use.",

    "Summary": "In this study, we systematically mapped the temporal and spatial distribution of gene expression in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) using single-cell RNA sequencing.The SCN is the main central pacemaker of mammalian circadian rhythms, but its cell types and their regulatory mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Seven major cell types were found in the SCN, including neurons, astrocytes, ventricular membrane cells and endothelial cells, which showed distinct cell type-specific circadian expression. In addition, five neuronal subtypes (e.g., Avp\u207a/Nms\u207a, Vip\u207a/Nms\u207a, Cck\u207a/Bdnf\u207a, etc.) differed in their rhythmicity, photoresponsiveness, and spatial distribution. differences in rhythmicity, light responsiveness and spatial distribution. It was also found that circadian expression in the SCN showed fluctuations propagating from backward to forward, and that Avp\u207a/Nms\u207a neurons may be the \u201cdominant player\u201d in this process.",

    "Summary": "During the development of the cerebral cortex, different subtypes of glutamategic neurons from the precursor cells that change automatically are generated and differentiated in turn. However, how precursor cells and their progeny cells are patterned in time remains unknown. This study used high-temporal resolution single-cell RNA sequencing to track the transcriptional trajectories of successive generations of apical precursor cells (APs) and their contemporary progeny neurons in the mouse neocortex. The study identified and functionally characterized a set of evolutionarily conserved temporal pattern genes that drive APs to transition from an intrinsic drive to a more externally sensitive state, revealing that the role of extracellular signals gradually increases during cortical generation. These embryonic-dependent APs molecular states manifest as continuous basal states in their neuronal progeny, essentially retaining early post-mitotic differentiation procedures. Thus, the molecular markers that unfold over time in precursor cells act as seeds of adult neuronal diversity in the progeny after which they are mitotic.",

    "Summary": "Focus on the non-coding regions of the superconservative genome, especially the superconservative enhancers located near the Arx gene. Through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, researchers created knockout mouse models that lack single or multiple ultraconservative enhancers. The results showed that although these mice showed survival and fertility under laboratory conditions, there were abnormalities in nerve and growth, including significant changes in neuronal populations and brain structural defects. These findings suggest that superconservative enhancers have important functions in normal development, and their extreme sequence conservatism may stem from subtle effects on fitness during evolution.",

    "Summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are two incurable and fatal neurodegenerative conditions. While distinct, they share many clinical, genetic, and pathological characteristics, and both show highly vulnerable layer 5 extratelencephalic-projecting cortical populations, including Betz cells in ALS2 and von Economo neurons (VENs) in FTLD. Here, we report the first single-cell atlas of the human primary motor cortex and its changes in ALS and FTLD across ~380,000 nuclei from 64 control, sporadic and C9orf72-associated ALS and FTLD individuals. We identify 46 transcriptionally distinct cellular subtypes including two Betz-cell subtypes, and observe a previously-unappreciated molecular similarity between Betz cells and VENs of the frontal insula. Most dysregulated genes and pathways were shared, including stress response, ribosome function, oxidative phosphorylation, synaptic vesicle cycle, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and autophagy. Betz cells and SCN4B+ long-range projecting L3/L5 cells are the most transcriptionally affected in both ALS and FTLD. Lastly, the VEN/Betz-cell-enriched dysregulated gene POU3F1 co-localizes with TDP-43 aggregates in Betz cells.",
